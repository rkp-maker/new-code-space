    <p style="font-size: 25px;">What, you thought the internet belonged to <b>everyone?</b></p>
    <p>NO, IT'S MINE!</p>
    <p>So what is this website about?</p>
    <p>It's about me, of course!</p>
    <p>What's there to know about me?</p>
    <p>Too much honestly!</p>
    <p>I'm obsssed with jewlery making!</p>
    <p>So much so, that all of my other hobbies feel to the wayside... (Its lowkey giving "shiny object syndrome")</p>
